# How to Get "Credit" for Your Commit (Sprint 1)

The Assessment Brief requires **"at least one commit from every group member"**.
Follow these steps exactly to ensure you get your marks.

## Prerequisites
1.  Ensure you have a GitHub account.
2.  Ensure you have been added as a "Collaborator" to the group repository.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Each Member

**Member 1 (Who has the code right now):**
1.  Initialize the repository (if not done):
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of FoodShare Green Tech Sprint 1"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
    git push -u origin main
    ```

**Members 2, 3, 4, & 5 (Do this one by one):**

1.  **Clone the Repo** (Get the code):
    ```bash
    git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
    cd foodshare_green_tech
    ```

2.  **Open `CONTRIBUTORS.md`**:
    *   Find your name in the list.
    *   Add your "Signature" (e.g., type " - Signed" next to your name).

3.  **Commit Your Change**:
    ```bash
    git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
    git commit -m "Signed by [YOUR NAME]"
    ```
    *   *Example: `git commit -m "Signed by Mahesh Batala"`*

4.  **Push to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

5.  **Tell the next member** it is their turn!

## Alternative: Using GitHub Website (Easiest Method)
If you don't have Git installed on your laptop, you can do this directly in the browser:

1.  Go to your GitHub Repository URL.
2.  Click on the file **`CONTRIBUTORS.md`**.
3.  Click the **Pencil Icon** (Edit this file).
4.  Add your signature next to your name.
5.  Scroll down to "Commit changes".
6.  Write a commit message: "Signed by [Your Name]".
7.  Click **Commit changes**.

**Done!** This counts as your required contribution.
