## 2. Project Description
**Problem:** Millions of tons of edible food are wasted annually while many people struggle with food insecurity.
**Solution:** A web application that connects individuals and businesses with surplus food to community members who can use it. The platform facilitates the listing, discovery, and claiming of free food items, promoting sustainability and community support.
**Scope (MVP):** User registration, posting food items, viewing available items on a map/list, and claiming items.

## 4. Personas

### Persona 1: Sameer, The Donor
*   **Bio:** Sameer is a 20-year-old software engineering student who works part-time at a local cafe. He hates seeing leftover pastries go to waste at the end of the day.
*   **Goal:** To easily list surplus food from his workplace or home so it can be claimed by students or locals in need.
*   **Frustrations:** The guilt of throwing away edible food; lack of an easy way to broadcast "free food" to his campus network without spamming group chats.

### Persona 2: Mahesh, The Receiver
*   **Bio:** Mahesh is a 22-year-old international student on a tight budget. He is passionate about sustainability and saving money on groceries.
*   **Goal:** To find free, safe, and edible food nearby to supplement his weekly meals and reduce his environmental footprint.
*   **Frustrations:** High cost of living in the city; difficulty navigating multiple apps to find affordable food; uncertainty about the quality of free items.

### Persona 3: Prativa, The Local Business Owner
*   **Bio:** Prativa runs a small artisan bakery. She ends every day with 5-10 loaves of bread that are perfectly good but cannot be sold as "fresh" tomorrow.
*   **Goal:** To donate bulk items quickly at closing time (5 PM) without managing complex logistics or waiting for individual pickups.
*   **Frustrations:** Paying for commercial waste disposal for food that is edible; lack of tax incentives or easy documentation for donations.

### Persona 4: Dhiraj, The Community Volunteer
*   **Bio:** Dhiraj organizes a local food bank distribution. He has a van and can collect larger donations.
*   **Goal:** To see a map of all available large donations in the district so he can plan a pickup route efficiently.
*   **Frustrations:** Arriving at a donor's location only to find the food has already been thrown away or claimed by someone else.

## 5. Ethical Issues Identified
*   **Food Safety:** Risk of sharing expired or unsafe food. **Mitigation:** Clear disclaimers, user ratings, and prohibiting high-risk items (e.g., raw meat/fish).
*   **Privacy:** Protecting user location data. **Mitigation:** Only showing approximate locations (postcode district) until a claim is confirmed.
*   **Inclusivity:** Ensuring the app is accessible to users with low digital literacy or older devices.
